# PCA and Clustering
Here is some of my scientific stats (not published, otherwise see refs). Basically, here are steps of validation and analyses of a typical neural response.

## 1. Data representation
###  raw data - visualization of neural response from volume scanning

Firstly, we 3D reconstructed the neural terminals and it's responses to stimuli.

### PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
The above responses can be encoded by dozens and hundreds of "channels" of a neuron's terminal. Therefore, it is very intuitive to apply PCA on the response representation space for data visualization. The methods we applied here are 'princomp' function in Matlab or 'PCA' function in Python Scikit-learn module


## 2. Clustering and Regression
